Shared workflows for the beeldengeluid GitHub organization.

## Releasing

The [Release Workflows](https://github.com/beeldengeluid/gha-workflows/actions/workflows/release-workflows.yml) workflow can be used to create releases. It can be started manually, but is also scheduled to run at the end of every day. Version numbers follow [Calender Versioning](https://calver.org/).
